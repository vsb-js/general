# Your submitted lab work should work 
If the task is just in one file and we run `node file.js` it should not crash! Unless the crash is expected and wanted thing! 
Or if it's project it should run with the start command. Probably `npm start` or in case we will have tets, it will be `npm test` 

### Why this rule?
It's important as a developer to check the code after you write it. If you would be a backend developer it's common that you write unit test for almost every line of code you write.
This is common in every company. (Unless you are super cheap startup / company who doesn't have money to write unit tests .... ) 
And btw you can write unit tests for React FE applications too ! https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html

Obvisouly in the end the FE should be tested by the end to end tests with the usage of browser automation tools like selenium and such. Usually written by QA (Quality Assurance) team  
Backend API should be tested by integration / API tests too. Those can be also written by the devs or by the QA team.  
  
In this course we will not be writing any / much tests for our code. There is not much time for it.  

In the development process, it's pretty "junior" thing to say that your featuer is done, you pass it to the QA team and they return it because it doesn't even work/run?
This just wastes everyone time (money).   

**So hopefully this rule will teach you to check your code after yourself!**
