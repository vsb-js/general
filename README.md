#### Labs evaluation
- Your work has to be submitted via GitHub classroom into your assigment repo before the deadline (7-14 days after the date of lab)
- 4 points for each lab 
  - 1 point - if we can run your file / project without error! Learn why this rule [here](https://github.com/vsb-js/general/blob/main/CODERUNS.md).
  - 3 points - for finishing the tasks properly ((finished tasks / amount of tasks) * 3)
##### Cheating / copying the code
It's OK to help each other out in the tasks. To tell your friend the solution. Link him the stack overflow answer or something. But in most cases the tasks are per multiple lines and we can really tell that you copied the code exactly 1:1 from someone else and didn't even changed single character.

In cases where code is copied 1:1, the person who had earlier commit will be given points. The person who copied will get 0.
And we highly not recommend giving your code to people to do 1:1 copy - we can easily make mistake and give the points to the one who copied and the original might get 0.

## Abstract
This course builds on the theoretical knowledge the student has learned in previous years about building software systems and puts them into practice in the world of JavaScript language. In this course students will learn how t
o create and deliver a full application which consists of frontend application build with modern framework React, GraphQL API layer and NodeJS backend connected to SQL DB.

## Outline
- Introduction to JavaScript - ECMAScript standards, JS Engines, basic syntax
- Advanced JS principles - Event Loop, Promises, NodeJS, NPM packages
- Backend with NodeJS - Express web server, simple API layer
- Backend with NodeJS - Data persistence with SQL using ORM library
- GraphQL API - Introduction to GraphQL
- GraphQL API - Express with Apollo server
- React - Introduction to library and components
- React - Hooks
- React - Consuming backend GraphQL API
- React - Application routing 


## Evaluation Process - Winter Semester
Lab Work Evaluation 50%  
Projects Work Evaluation 50%

##### The project will be split into 2 parts. 
1st part (20 points) - NodeJS Express Server with GraphQL  
2nd part (30 points) - Front End application written in React which will be connected to the 1st part
