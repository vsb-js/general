## Lectures
- 00 Introduction to the subject - XXX
- 01 Introduction to JavaScript - XXX

## Project - FE React App

## Labs

- 01 N/A
  -  Homework:
      - Install NodeJS LTS version (verify using `node -v` in terminal)
      - Install git (verify using `git --verison` in terminal)
      - Make sure you have GitHub account and properly setup your machine to work with git
      - Install IDE of your choice for JS (Recommended VSC or WebStorm)
      - Send us your GitHub handle (username)

#### Labs evaluation
- Your work has to be submitted via GitHub classroom into your assigment repo before the deadline (7-14 days after the date of lab)
- 3 - 4 points for each lab 
  - 4 points - for finishing the tasks properly ((finished tasks / amount of tasks) * 4)
  - -1 point - if we can not run your file / project should be without error! Learn why this rule [here](https://github.com/vsb-js/general/blob/main/CODERUNS.md).

  
##### Cheating / copying the code
It's OK to help each other out in the tasks. To tell your friend the solution. Link him the stack overflow answer or something. But in most cases the tasks are per multiple lines and we can really tell that you copied the code exactly 1:1 from someone else and didn't even changed single character.

In cases where code is copied 1:1, both students get 0 points.
