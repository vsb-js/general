## Labs
- 01 N/A
  -  Homework:
      - Install [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version (verify using `node -v` in terminal)
      - Install [git](https://desktop.github.com/) (verify using `git --verison` in terminal) - You can also use [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) - might be easier) 
      - Make sure you have GitHub account and properly setup your machine to work with git (You should be able to push into your repositories on GitHub - you can use the GitHub desktop app to do that.
      - Install IDE of your choice for JS (Recommended [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (Similary to PyCharm))
      - Send us your GitHub handle (username)

- 02 Basic of JavaScript
  - Assigment https://classroom.github.com/a/n6RKb8ld
  - You can get up to 4 points for:
    - All tasks in file array.js 1pts
    - All tasks in file objects.js 1pts
    - All tasks in file strings.js 1pts
    - All tasks in file cycles.js 1pts
  - You can gain 1 extra point for all tasks marked as BONUS 

#### Labs evaluation
- Your work has to be submitted via GitHub classroom into your assigment repo before the deadline (7-14 days after the date of lab)
- 3 - 4 points for each lab 
  - 4 points - for finishing the tasks properly ((finished tasks / amount of tasks) * 4)
  - -1 point - if we can not run your file / project should be without error! Learn why this rule [here](https://github.com/vsb-js/general/blob/main/CODERUNS.md).

  
##### Cheating / copying the code
It's OK to help each other out in the tasks. To tell your friend the solution. Link him the stack overflow answer or something. But in most cases the tasks are per multiple lines and we can really tell that you copied the code exactly 1:1 from someone else and didn't even changed single character.

In cases where code is copied 1:1, both students get 0 points.

- Backend with NodeJS - Data persistence with SQL using ORM library
- REST API
- React - Introduction to library and components
- React - Hooks
- React - Consuming backend GraphQL API
- React - Application routing 


## Evaluation Process - Winter Semester
